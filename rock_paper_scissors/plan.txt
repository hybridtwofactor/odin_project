Goal
-------------------
Simple implementation of classic "rock paper scissors"

Plan
-------------------
- play against the computer
- functions
    - getComputerChoice
        - randomly return "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors"
        - use this function to get computer to play
    - round --> parameters: playerSelection, computerSelection
        - return a string that declares the winner of the round
            - "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
    - game
        - play 5 round game
        - keeps score
        - reports winner and loser at the end
        - use console.log() to display results of each round and winner
        - prompt to get input from user
- make function's playerSelection case-insensitive (e.g. user can input rock, ROCK, RocK)

Pseudocode
--------------------
getComputerChoice():
randomise a choice from "rock", "paper" or "scissors"
return choice

round(playerSelection, computerSelection):
lowercase playerSelection variable
if playerSelection equals to computerSelection
    return tie
else if playerSelection equals scissors, computer selection equals paper
    return winner is player
else if playerSelection equals scissors, computer selection equals rock
    return winner is computer
else if playerSelection equals paper, computer selection equals rock
    return winner is player
else if playerSelection equals paper, computer selection equals scissors
    return winner is computer
else if playerSelection equals rock, computer selection equals scissors
    return winner is player
else if playerSelection equals rock, computer selection equals paper
    return winner is computer
return string to declare winner - "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"

game():
    variable playerScore
    variable computerScore
    prompt user to input selection
    play five games
        call round(playerSelection, getComputerChoice()) function
        if round winner is player 
            increment playerScore
        else if round winner is computer
            increment commputerScore
        else
            tie
    if playerScore greater than computerScore
        declare player wins
    else if computerScore greater than playerScore
        declare computer wins
    else
        tie
    

function game() {
    let playerScore = 0;
    let computerScore = 0;
    let roundResult;

    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        let playerSelection = prompt("What's your selection? rock, paper or scissors?")
        roundResult = round(playerSelection, getComputerChoice());
        if (roundResult === "player") {
            playerScore++;
        } else if (roundResult === "computer") {
            computerScore++;
        }
    }

    if (playerScore > computerScore) {
        console.log("Player wins!");
    } else if (computerScore > playerScore) {
        console.log("Player wins!");
    } else if (computerScore === playerScore) {
        console.log("Tie!");
    } 
    console.log(`Player score is ${playerScore}`);
    console.log(`Computer score is ${computerScore}`);
