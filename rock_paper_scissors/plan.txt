Goal
-------------------
Simple user interface implementation of classic "rock paper scissors"

Plan
-------------------
- rework code to attach event listeners to the buttons - calls playRound()
- hold player's and computer's selection for a few seconds
- show computer's selection 0.07s after player for user's smooth eye movement
    so they know what's happening
- display score on the scoreboard
- announce win, tie or loss, keep log
